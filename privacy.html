  <h1>Privacy Policy - App "[APP_NAME]"</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: [DATE]</p>

  <h2>1. Controller</h2>
  <p>
    The controller within the meaning of applicable data protection laws (in particular GDPR) is:
  </p>
  <p>
    [PROVIDER_NAME]<br>
    [PROVIDER_ADDRESS]<br>
    Email: [CONTACT_EMAIL]<br>
    Website: [WEBSITE_URL]
  </p>

  <h2>2. Contact for data protection requests</h2>
  <p>
    If you have questions about data protection or wish to exercise your rights, please contact us at:
    Email: [PRIVACY_EMAIL] (or: [CONTACT_EMAIL])
  </p>

  <h2>3. Short overview (summary)</h2>
  <p>We process personal data in particular to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>show ads (including personalized ads) and enable ad delivery,</li>
    <li>process in-app purchases and restore purchases,</li>
    <li>prevent abuse and fraud and ensure the security of our systems,</li>
    <li>handle support requests.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Depending on your region, we request your consent for personalized advertising/trackers via a
    consent management platform (CMP) (see section 7).
  </p>

  <h2>4. Definitions</h2>
  <p>
    "Personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable person.
    "Processing" means, for example, the collection, storage, use, transfer, or deletion of data.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data processing when using the app (local data)</h2>
  <p>
    The app is a life-simulator game. Save files and settings are generally stored locally on your device
    (for example, save slots, game progress, and preferences). These local data are not automatically
    transmitted to us unless you use features that require server communication (for example purchase
    verification/restore or support).
  </p>

  <h2>6. App stores / platforms</h2>
  <p>
    Downloading and installing the app is handled by platform providers (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store).
    Those providers process data under their own responsibility (e.g., account data, payment processing,
    device information). Please review their privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Advertising (Google Mobile Ads / AdMob), personalization, CMP (TCF v2.2)</h2>
  <h3>7.1 Ad partners / SDK</h3>
  <p>
    We use Google advertising services (Google Mobile Ads SDK / AdMob) to show ads in the app (including rewarded ads).
  </p>
  <p>
    Google (and, depending on configuration, Google mediation partners) may process data to deliver ads,
    measure performance, and prevent abuse.
  </p>

  <h3>7.2 Categories of data (typically during ad delivery)</h3>
  <p>In connection with advertising, the following data may be processed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>device and ad identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID, IDFA, App-Set-ID, or similar identifiers),</li>
    <li>IP address and derived coarse location (e.g., country/city level),</li>
    <li>app usage and interaction data (e.g., ad impressions, clicks, video views, timestamps),</li>
    <li>technical information and diagnostics (e.g., crash/performance data, error codes, network info).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The exact data depend on device, OS, settings, and your consent (see 7.3).
  </p>

  <h3>7.3 Consent, CMP and IAB TCF v2.2 (Europe)</h3>
  <p>
    Where required (in particular in the EEA/UK/Switzerland), we obtain consent for personalized ads/trackers
    via a certified CMP that supports IAB TCF v2.2 (e.g., Google User Messaging Platform / UMP).
  </p>
  <p>
    Your consent choices and a TCF consent string may be stored and transmitted to Google and ad partners
    to technically implement your selection.
  </p>
  <p>
    Legal basis (where applicable): consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) and, for storing/accessing information on
    your device where required, applicable national laws (e.g., TTDSG in Germany).
  </p>

  <h3>7.4 Withdrawal / change of consent</h3>
  <p>You can withdraw or change your consent at any time with effect for the future:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>in the app at: [IN_APP_PRIVACY_PATH],</li>
    <li>and/or in device settings (e.g., reset ad ID / tracking settings).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you do not consent or withdraw, we will show non-personalized/contextual ads or limited ads where available.
  </p>

  <h3>7.5 iOS - App Tracking Transparency (ATT)</h3>
  <p>
    If we (or our ad partners) need access to IDFA or "tracking" as defined by Apple policies, this will only
    occur after your explicit consent via the iOS ATT prompt. Without consent, personalized ads may be limited.
  </p>

  <h2>8. In-app purchases, verification and restore</h2>
  <h3>8.1 In-app purchases via Apple/Google</h3>
  <p>
    In-app purchases are processed by Apple or Google. We typically do not receive payment data (e.g., credit card data),
    but rather transaction/purchase information required to unlock or restore purchases.
  </p>
  <p>Processed data may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>product ID (e.g., purchased item),</li>
    <li>transaction ID / purchase token,</li>
    <li>purchase date/status,</li>
    <li>platform (iOS/Android),</li>
    <li>purchase receipt (if needed for verification).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Legal basis: contract performance (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR).</p>

  <h3>8.2 Server-side verification / restore server (linking user and purchase)</h3>
  <p>
    To verify purchases and enable restore, we may send transaction information to our backend server and
    store/process it there.
  </p>
  <p>Depending on implementation, we may use a pseudonymous user identifier, for example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a restore/user ID generated in the app, or</li>
    <li>another technical identifier required to map entitlements to a user.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>purchase verification (abuse/fraud prevention),</li>
    <li>entitlement management and unlocking content,</li>
    <li>restore after reinstall or device change,</li>
    <li>support for purchase issues.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Legal bases:<br>
    - contract performance (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR),<br>
    - legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) in security, fraud prevention, and technical traceability.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Support and communications</h2>
  <p>
    If you contact us by email or other channels, we process the data you provide (e.g., email address, request content,
    purchase proof) to handle your request.
  </p>
  <p>
    Legal basis: legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or contract performance (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) when it concerns entitlements.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Logs / server logs</h2>
  <p>
    When the app communicates with our servers (e.g., purchase verification/restore), technical log data are generated, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>IP address,</li>
    <li>time and type of request,</li>
    <li>device/app information (e.g., version),</li>
    <li>response codes / error data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These data are processed to ensure operation, analyze errors, and prevent abuse.
  </p>
  <p>Legal basis: legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).</p>

  <h2>11. Recipients / data sharing</h2>
  <p>We share personal data only when necessary:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>with ad partners/SDK providers (Google Mobile Ads / AdMob) for ad delivery and measurement,</li>
    <li>with platform providers (Apple/Google) for in-app purchases (under their responsibility),</li>
    <li>with technical service providers (hosting/server operations) acting as processors,</li>
    <li>if required by law or for legal enforcement.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    No sale of personal data takes place, subject to definitions under CCPA/CPRA (see section 16).
  </p>

  <h2>12. International data transfers (e.g., USA)</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on service providers (e.g., Google), data may be processed outside the EEA (e.g., USA). Where required,
    appropriate safeguards (e.g., EU Standard Contractual Clauses) are used or other lawful transfer mechanisms apply.
  </p>

  <h2>13. Retention</h2>
  <p>We store personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>purchase/entitlement data (restore): as long as needed for provisioning/restore or until deletion by the user, unless legal retention obligations apply.</li>
    <li>server logs: typically for a limited period (e.g., [X DAYS/WEEKS]) and then deleted or anonymized, unless needed longer for abuse prevention.</li>
    <li>support requests: for as long as required to handle and document the request, then deleted per internal policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>14. Account/data deletion (in-app) and web link (store requirement)</h2>
  <h3>14.1 Deletion in the app</h3>
  <p>
    You can request deletion of server-side data linked to your pseudonymous user identifier (especially restore/entitlement data)
    directly in the app:
    [IN_APP_DELETE_PATH]
  </p>

  <h3>14.2 Deletion without the app (web URL)</h3>
  <p>
    We also provide a web option to request deletion without reinstalling the app:
    [DELETE_ACCOUNT_URL]
  </p>
  <p>Deletion request page: <a href="delete.html">delete.html</a></p>
  <p>
    There you can request deletion and see which data are affected. If identification is required, we may use a restore/user ID
    shown in the app or appropriate proof (e.g., transaction information) to prevent abuse.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Important note:</strong> Deleting server-side linking data (restore/entitlement data) may mean that previously purchased in-app items can no longer be restored via our restore service after a reinstall or on another device. Re-unlocking may then only be possible if a restore through the app store (Apple/Google) is technically available and we can verify the purchase again.</p>

  <h2>15. Your rights under GDPR (EEA/Switzerland/UK, where applicable)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR),</li>
    <li>Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR),</li>
    <li>Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR),</li>
    <li>Right to restriction (Art. 18 GDPR),</li>
    <li>Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR),</li>
    <li>Right to object to processing based on legitimate interests (Art. 21 GDPR),</li>
