  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: 2026-01-26</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how ReLife ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and
    shares information when you use the ReLife mobile app (the "App").
  </p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Game progress is stored locally on your device.</li>
    <li>Purchase verification data may be sent to our server to confirm ownership.</li>
    <li>If ads are shown, ad partners may collect device identifiers to serve ads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>On-device data</h3>
  <p>
    Your game progress, settings, and preferences are stored on your device. This data is
    used to provide the gameplay experience and is not required to create an account.
  </p>

  <h3>Purchase verification</h3>
  <p>
    If you purchase DLC or subscriptions, we may send purchase tokens/transaction IDs to our
    server to verify ownership and restore purchases across devices. The server stores purchase
    status and entitlement flags linked to a device identifier.
  </p>

  <h3>Ads</h3>
  <p>
    If the App shows rewarded ads, our ad partners (such as Google AdMob) may collect device
    identifiers, IP address, and limited usage data to serve and measure ads.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and maintain the App.</li>
    <li>To verify purchases and restore entitlements.</li>
    <li>To show ads and measure ad performance when ads are enabled.</li>
    <li>To improve the App and fix bugs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We share data with third-party services only as needed to provide purchases or ads.
    These services include app store billing providers and ad networks.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We keep purchase verification data as long as needed to provide entitlements and comply
    with legal obligations. You can request deletion by contacting us.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can delete the App to remove local game data.</li>
    <li>You can contact us to request deletion of server-stored purchase data.</li>
  </ul>
