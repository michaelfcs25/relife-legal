  <p>
    You can request deletion of server-side data stored by us (e.g., restore/entitlement data for in-app purchases) as follows:
  </p>

  <h2>1) In the app (recommended)</h2>
  <p>Open in the app:</p>
  <p>Settings -> Privacy -> Delete account/data</p>
  <p>There you can trigger deletion directly.</p>

  <h2>2) Without the app (web request)</h2>
  <p>If you no longer have the app installed, you can request deletion here:</p>
  <p>Please send an email to: info@reimgen.com</p>
  <p>Subject: "Deletion request ReLife"</p>
  <p>If available, include a restore/user ID shown in the app:</p>
  <p>Settings -> Privacy -> Restore ID</p>
  <p>
    If you do not have a restore/user ID, please provide suitable proof so we can match your request
    (e.g., transaction ID / order ID from the store receipt). We use this information solely to
    prevent abuse and process your deletion request correctly.
  </p>

  <h2>Which data are deleted?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Server-side restore/entitlement data (mapping "user ID &lt;-&gt; purchase status"),</li>
    <li>related technical log data, unless required longer for security or legal reasons.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What is not deleted?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Data stored only locally on your device (e.g., save games) can be deleted in the app or by uninstalling.</li>
    <li>Data we must retain for legal reasons (e.g., to fulfill legal obligations) may be blocked and deleted after retention periods expire.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Processing time</h2>
  <p>
    We process deletion requests as quickly as possible and confirm deletion or status via reply.
